	    			Just waiting for her to say ok go outside.<br>
					With a kiss on the cheek & a hug that's so tight.<br>
					He heads for the door with six guns at side.<br>
					There are outlaws to catch, wild ponies to rides, gotta get them doggies before it gets night.<br>
					With rope in his hand & hat pulled down tight, he saddles his pony & gets ready to ride.<br>

					I'm the toughest of cowboys! He shouts to his steed.
					<br>Ain't sacred of no outlaw, Indian, or thief!<br>
					But even the toughest of cowboys get dumped.<br>
					And he came thru the front door with tears & a lump. His mama was there to ease his pain. With a kiss & a hug it all went away.<br>
				</span>
				
				<span class="pa2-2">
					<br>With red hair & freckles & a bump on his chin, he was off riding the trails once again.<br>
					She knows that someday the time will come, she'll have to cut the fences & just let him run.<br>
					But with red hair & freckles & those shiny brown eyes.<br>
					He's mama's little cowboy, her joy & pride.<br>
