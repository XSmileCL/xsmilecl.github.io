		He looks at his mama with wonder & wait.

		<h6>
		Those brown eyes a shining & looking so bright.

		Just <em>waiting for</em> her <em>to say</em> ok <strong>go outside.</strong>
	</ul>

<h4>With a kiss on the cheek & a hug that's so tight.</h4>

<ul>
	<div>
		He <em>heads for </em>the door with six guns at side.
	</div>
		There are outlaws <em>to catch</em>, wild ponies <em>to rides.</em>
	<div>
		Gotta <em>get</em> them doggies before it <em>gets</em> night.
	</div>
	<div>
		With rope in his hand & hat <em>pulled down</em> tight, he <em>saddles</em> his pony & <em>gets ready to</em> ride.
	</div>
</ul>

<h4>I'm the toughest of cowboys! He <em>shouts to</em> his steed.</h4>
<ul>Ain't <em>sacred of</em> no outlaw, Indian, or thief!
<div>But even the toughest of cowboys <em>get dumped.</em></div>
And he <em>came</em> thru the  front door with tears & a lump.
<div>His mama <em>was</em> there to ease his pain. With a <em>kiss</em> & a <em>hug</em> it all <em>went away</em>.</div></ul>

<h4>With red hair & freckles & a bump on his chin, he was off riding the trails once again.</h4>
<ul>She <em>knows</em> that someday the time <em>will come</em>,
She'll <em>have to cut</em> the fences & just <em>let</em> him run.
<div>But with red hair & freckles & those shiny brown eyes.</div>
He's mama's little cowboy, her joy & pride.</ul>
