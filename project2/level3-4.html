	<div class="paragraph1">With red hair, freckles & a peanut butter face,
	he looks at his mama with wonder & wait.<br>Those brown eyes a shining & looking so bright.</div>

	<div class="paragraph2">
	Just waiting for her to say ok go outside.<br>
	With a kiss on the cheek & a hug that's so tight.<br>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph3">
	<h4>He heads for the door with six guns at side.<br>
	There are outlaws to catch, wild ponies to rides, 
	gotta get them doggies before it gets night.<br>
	With rope in his hand & hat pulled down tight, he saddles his pony & gets ready to ride.<br></h4>

	<div class="paragraph4">
	I'm the toughest of cowboys! He shouts to his steed.<br>
	Ain't sacred of no outlaw, Indian, or thief!<br>
	But even the toughest of cowboys get dumped.<br>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph5">
	And he came thru the front door with tears & a lump.<br>
	His mama was there to ease his pain. With a kiss & a hug it all went away.<br>
	With red hair & freckles & a bump on his chin, he was off riding the trails once again.<br>
	</div>

	<div class="paragraph6">
	She knows that someday the time will come,
	She'll have to cut the fences & just let him run.<br>
	But with red hair & freckles & those shiny brown eyes.<br>
	He's mama's little cowboy, her joy & pride.<br>
