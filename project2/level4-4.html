			<h3>He heads for the door with six guns at side.<br>
			There are outlaws to catch, wild ponies to rides, 
			gotta get them doggies before it gets night.<br>
			With rope in his hand & hat pulled down tight, he saddles his pony & gets ready to ride.<br></h3>

			<h3>I'm the toughest of cowboys! He shouts to his steed.<br>
			Ain't sacred of no outlaw, Indian, or thief!<br>
			But even the toughest of cowboys get dumped.<br></h3>

			<em>And he came through the front door with tears & a lump.<br>
			His mama was there to ease his pain. With a kiss & a hug it all went away.<br>
			With red hair & freckles & a bump on his chin, he was off riding the trails once again.<br></em>

			<h3>She knows that someday the time will come,
			She'll have to cut the fences & just let him run.<br>
			But with red hair & freckles & those shiny brown eyes.<br>
			He's mama's little cowboy, her joy & pride.<br></h3>
