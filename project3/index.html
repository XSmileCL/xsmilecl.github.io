							<p>In the Living City man is the ultimate subject and principal conditioner. The theme is interpreted by presenting evocations, accentuations and simulations of city life, not a display of suggested forms. The image is a total image of it all like a film.<br>The exhibition cannot be said to be a review, for its programme is evolutionary and it can only be definitive in relation to the actual experience within the exhibition itself. Can we predict the balance of evocations of the ‘city’ until we see them for the first time? Whether this exhibition is a valuable gesture depends upon whether one demands a single line of argument, whether one states that black is black and white is white, and, moreover, that they are diametrically opposite.

			<p>Certainly, Living City has come about as the reply to the situation as it appears to us, who are involved in the creation and evaluation of environment. We are in a European city, of long-established precedents, but with no clear way ahead for us to build upon them. The re-creation of environment is too often a jaded process, having to do only with densities, allocations of space, fulfillment of regulations: the spirit of cities is lost in the process. It is from America that the real warning has come. William H. Whyte in the Exploding Metropolis and more recently Jane Jacobs in Death and Life of Great American Cities treat the threat of the denouement of city centres with a concern that is at the same time intelligent and frightening. They search hard for any signs of reversal of the general trend, or a way out, or some path back to the situation when ‘city’ meant something vibrating with life. The Atlantic time-lag is about to catch up with us. The problem facing our cities is not just that of their regeneration, but of their right to an existence.<br>The real terror for us is that the cities we have will be sacrificed for an overall conformity covering the whole of this piece of Europe, for endless suburban communities, providing, it is admitted, a high standard of material comfort, but devoid of the quality of the city, because in the process this will have died.

					<p>In the various studies that built up the total [Plug-in City] project, one can trace the succession of priorities that are gradually overlaid, and one can see how the sections evolved.</p>

					<p>The Nottingham project was a proposal for shopping, but the problems of frequent servicing and the unit replacement were complementary. A major part of the Plug-In proposition already existed. With the craneway running along the viaduct and a service tunnel system, it is only a short step to the incorporation of housing elements.

			<p>The Plug-in City as a total project was the combination of a series of ideas that were worked upon between 1962 and 1964. The Metal Cabin Housing was a prototype in the sense that it placed removable house elements into a ‘megastructure’ of concrete. The discussions of Archigram 2 and 3 built up a pressure of argument in favour of expendable buildings: and it was then inevitable that we should investigate what happens if the whole urban environment can be programmed and structured for change.
			<img class=images src="images/002.jpg">
			<br>It is difficult to state which phase of the work on Plug-in City forms the definitive project. During the whole period 1962–66 elements were being looked at, and notions amended or extended as necessary: so the drawings inevitably contain many inconsistencies. The term ‘city’ is used as a collective, the project being a portmanteau for several ideas, and does not necessarily imply a replacement of known cities.</p>

			<p>An ability to dream up next year’s architectural modes relies not only on a knowledge of what next year’s materials will do for you (plastic skins that dissolve in the sunlight to reform again when it gets cold, buildings that can be brought to the site in a test tube and allowed to bud) but also on being able to see the meaning and significance behind such shrines of our mechanised society as drive-in cinemas, mobile homes, gadgetry, cars that can turn themselves into caravans or boats, supermarket doors that can open as you walk up to them, U-haul trailers, etc. If you take the car, it can be a status-symbol, male virility-object and what-have-you means of getting about that’s fun to own and drive, but it can also be a mobile room which can plug itself into a drive-in bank and become extra floor area of that bank.
