                &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;red hair, <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;freckles and a peanut butter face, <br><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He looks at his mama with wonder and wait. <br>
                Those brown eyes a shining and looking so bright. 
                Just waiting for her to say ok go outside.
                With a kiss on the cheek and a hug that's so tight.
                He heads for the door with six guns at side.
                There are outlaws to catch, wild ponies to rides, 
                Gotta get them doggies before it gets night.
                With rope in his hand and hat pulled down tight, he saddles his pony and gets ready to ride.

I'm the toughest of cowboys! He shouts to his steed.
Ain't sacred of no outlaw, Indian, or thief!
But even the toughest of cowboys get dumped.
And he came thru the front door with tears and a lump.
His mama was there to ease his pain. With a kiss and a hug it all went away.
With red hair and freckles and a bump on his chin, he was off riding the trails once again.
She knows that someday the time will come,
She'll have to cut the fences and just let him run.
But with red hair and freckles and those shiny brown eyes.
He's mama's little cowboy, her joy and pride.
